# Multiverse Portfolio

This repo is a collection of some of my learning and contributions during my 2022-2023 apprenticeship at American Express sponsored by Multiverse.

## Overview
My time at American Express and Multiverse has been full of so much growth. I never thought I could learn so much in so little time. I have not only become a crucial part of my team but have also made a few friends along the way and at the same time love what I do. I will forever be greatful for this opportunity.
